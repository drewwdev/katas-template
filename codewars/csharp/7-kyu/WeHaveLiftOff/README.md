You have an array of numbers 1 through n (where 1 <= n <= 10). The array needs to be formatted correctly for the person reading the countdown of a spaceship launch.

Unfortunately, the person reading the countdown only knows how to read strings. After the array is sorted correctly make sure it's in a format he can understand.

Between each number should be a space and after the final number (n) should be the word 'liftoff!'

get the array
convert the array into a list
sort the list
convert each element in the list to a string
append each element of the list onto a string with a blank space after each element
append "liftoff!" at the end
