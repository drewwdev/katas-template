Upcto and including n, this function will return the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5.

For example:

findSum(5) should return 8 (3 + 5)

findSum(10) should return 33 (3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10)

make a counter variable
make an empty list if int
go through each item in the original list
if item is a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 5 add it to a list
when you reach a given number add each item together in the list that started empty
